A web application will aim to be so intuitive that there is no end user manual
required. But end user manuals are required for certain products, and no matter
how intuitive your product is, there are always questions.

Some sort of support manual exists, but usually support manuals are too much
problem oriented, and a well written product manual can be a great asset for
selling your product.

Note: While we are calling it the end user manual, itâ€™s probably not going to be
exposed to end users. If it's an open source product, sure it may be, but other
companies may choose to limit the details exposed. Even for open source products,
this manual may be too overwhelming for a day to day user. The point of this manual
is to fully capture all product decisions (as far as the end user is concerned).
A good rule of thumb is, a complete product manual will allow a competent tech team
to fully re-create the functionality of the currently deployed product without talking
to any product manager.

Product manual should be organised into:

- [Overview & Why](web/product/overview/)
- [Features & Journeys](web/product/features/)
- [Pages, Actions, APIs, Communications](web/product/sitemap/)
