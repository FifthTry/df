-- ds.page-with-toc: “Table” Name
sub-sections: $config.web-product-header
toc: $config.developer-manual-toc

There should be a document for every table in the database. These documents
should be organised as sub pages of a corresponding database document.

In no SQL databases, we will have some “logical” tables, key patterns that
contain similar data. They should have their own page as well.


-- ds.h1: Name

The name of the table.


-- ds.h1: Schema

Schema of the table can be represented in either SQL form, if the table
is created using authored SQL, or it can contain the ORM model definition
if the table is created/managed by an ORM.


-- ds.h1: Field

For every field of the table there should be a subheading. In this
subheading discuss the type of the column, indexes and constraints on this
column.


-- ds.h1: Enum Fields

Some fields or columns are going to be enum like, with only few values allowed.
For example, a common enum-like field is the “status” column in many tables.
The status field represents a state machine. In such fields values should be
documented.


-- ds.h1: Compound Indexes

Some indexes are going to span multiple fields, such indexes can be listed by name
separately after documenting all fields.


-- ds.h1: ORM Details

If the table is managed by an ORM, then ORM specific details can be listed here.
In Django applications you may want to list if the admin application is configured
for this table. If you have a custom model manager for this table that should be
listed here. If the ORM class mapping for this table has interesting helper functions,
they can be listed here.

Depending on the complexity of the ORM, a dedicated Document ORM can also be created.


-- ds.h1: Common Queries

If there are some common queries, like for a user table, often it’s interesting to keep
a group by query for user joining this month handy for early startups. Often you would
not put the common queried in the document itself, but will have some data exploration
tool installed and queries configured there, this section can then contain instructions on
how to reach the exploration tool.
