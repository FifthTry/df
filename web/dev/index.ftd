Developers, both frontend and backend, QA team, devops etc are all targets
of your developer manual. A complete developer manual will allow a competent
team to fully take over the ownership of the current technology and keep on
producing features at almost the same pace as the original team, without talking
to anyone in the original tech team.

Similarly a new person should be able to join an existing team, set up their machines
for development, understand how services are to be run, how to update databases, how to
add various features, without much hand holding.

Code is the best documentation, so the developer manual will point to code in
different places.
